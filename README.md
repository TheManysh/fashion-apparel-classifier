## Fashion Apparels Classification

### Problem Statement

The problem is to classify the fashion apparels into 10 different categories. The dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images. The class labels are:

0. Goggles
1. Hat
2. Jacket
3. Shirt
4. Shoes
5. Shorts
6. Trouser
7. T-Shirt
8. Wallet
9. Watch

### Solution

The solution is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the fashion apparels into 10 different categories. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.
